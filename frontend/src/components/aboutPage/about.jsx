        We are three coders who teamed up during or final sprint of the <a href="https://www.technigo.io/">Technigo</a> webdeveloper bootcamp to bring you the Foodie moodie app. 
        Are you tired of never knowing where to go for dinner? Have you ever been on a really hot date and ended up at a restaurant with kids hanging in the chandeliers or the opposite, 
        taking your kids out to a nice dinner only to find your self at a place that is stiffer than a job interview. We want to give you the best experience depending on the occasion and the mood you want to set, 
        whether it's a nice date, a family dinner, catching up with friends or ending a relationship. We got you covered,  just go to the startpage and start to tailor your perfect occasion!
